# rust-leet-code

### **MUST READ**
this is **_not_** a repository for people seeking to learn how to complete Rust problems on leet code. i am but a wee rustacean. i repeat this is **_not_** a good learning resource, unless you're on a mission to figure out how newbs go about constructing Rust programs. the goal is to get more comfortable with Rust and eventually writing some solid idiotmatic code. i'm like not there at all.

some of these responses will have borrowed code, and if that is the case, i will acredit the original authors in the header of my code. also, some of these problems will be **comment heavy**. i want to be able to simulate my thinking and also be able to look back at my responses in the future and not have to guess what the fuck i was thinking whenever i wrote something.
